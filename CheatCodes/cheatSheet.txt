** C++ Cheat Sheet **
------------------------

1) Class is basically a user-defined data type

2) The variables of class is known as objects

3) Class contains following
   (a) Data members :  The variable that are defined inside the class
   (b) Member functions : The functions that are defined inside the class
       These member function can operate only on the variable defined inside the class

4) Constructor : A special function without any return type and is called automatically
   upon creation of objects of class

5) Construct can be default (without any parameters), or parameterized constructor.

6) Its always a good practice to define constructor. These are used to set the data member
   upon creation of object.
   

7) If the constructors are not defined, the compiler will create a default constructor.

8) But if any constructor is defined by user, the compiler will not create the default constructor, which is sometimes requiried, otherwise the code will not compile

9) Hence, One must define a default constructor to avoid silly compilation error.

10) Two types of classes are there:
   (a) Abstract classes
   (b) Concrete classes

11) Object of Concrete classes can be made

12) Object of Abstract classes cannot be made

13) Inheriting an abstract class forces to implement all the pure virtual function
   otherwise the derived class itself become an Abstract class

14) Pointers of base class can hold the reference to the object of base class
    (A very important concept, which is extremely used while write Geant4 simulation code)

15) If a base class pointer is hold a reference to derived class object. Then it can be converted to derived class pointer static casting as follows:
    
    Derived  *derivedPtr = static_cast<Derived*>(basePtr)

16) Geant4 is a toolkit consists of thousands of classes, and it exploits the concept of inheritance, Hence keeping above points in mind will help in writing good simulation code.
