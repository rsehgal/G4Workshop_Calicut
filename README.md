GEANT4 WORKSHOP : University of Calicut  
--------------------------------------------------  
  
**This repository contains programs to be used during the Workshop**  

**Prerequisites** :   
1) Geant :  4.11.x  
2) ROOT  

**Plaease follow the below mentioned steps**  
1) Download the code from the repository by clicking the following link  
   https://github.com/rsehgal/G4Workshop_Calicut/archive/refs/heads/main.zip  

2) Unzip the file  
 
3) There is a directory called ShellScripts which contains a helper shell script that can be used to generated the Skeleton Geant4 application.  
   Go inside ShellScripts directory and run following command   
   . create_geant_app.sh [projectName]  
   For Eg.    
   . create_geant_app.sh Dummy  

4) This will create a sample skeleton Geant4 application.  

5) Try to compile that appication using cmake : Compilation steps follows:  
   **cd Dummy  
   mkdir build  
   cd build  
   make**  

6) This will create an executable with the same as your project name.
   In the current case this is **Dummy**  
  
7) Run the executable  
   **./Dummy**  

NOTE : This will just create a skeleton application. You have to add the code as per the handon exercise mentioned here  

---------------------------------------------  
COMPILING the Tracking code
---------------------------------------------  
Simple simulation code is provided to generated the data required for **Track reconstruction** excercise 2, 3, 4 below  

Here are the instructions to compile and run the code 

1) Inside the Tracking directory create a build sub-directory.  

2) cd build  
   cmake ..  
   make  
   Compilation done  
   
3) Now run the code:  
   **./Tracking  muon.mac**    
   The number events can be changed in the muon.mac file by changing **/run/beamOn**

HANDS-ON Exercises  
------------------------------   

1) https://github.com/rsehgal/G4Workshop_Calicut/issues/1  (Generate skeleton and add you logic)

NOTE : Below mentioned excercises need data file, that can be generated by running the example application : **Tracking**  
     
2) https://github.com/rsehgal/G4Workshop_Calicut/issues/2  (Code provided : **hough.cpp**)  

3) https://github.com/rsehgal/G4Workshop_Calicut/issues/3  (Code provided : **momentumRECO.cpp**)
